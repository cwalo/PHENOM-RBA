An iOS soundboard app that utilizes a custom AU-based file player class https://github.com/cwalo/cwaudiofilesampler

* To use your own samples, simply add them to your project and modify FileSamples.plist. 
* Each sample in the plist requires a file name, a file extension, and the name to be displayed on the respective button.

From there, you can modify the storyboard file to look any way you want. Have fun!
